# Project Campus Pilot

The school communication platform for the post-modern era.

## Features

The goal isn't to completely replace school's infrastructure, but rather
complement it in the form of simple, easy-to-use tools.

- Scoped announcements
    - Teachers can make announcements that are only visible to users to fit the
      scope criteria 
- Student Information System
    - Users with the right permissions can view each student, what class,
      subject and their contact info
- Scheduling
    - allows the admin to define a schedule, which will show up personalized for
      a teacher
    - allow for proxies to be setup 

## Tech-Stack

- The back-end is a RestAPI built using Python and Django
- The front-end is built using Dart, Flutter and Material design system
